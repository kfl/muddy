Changes for upcoming MuDDy release


2002-03-18: muddy.c: only print greeting in debug mode.
	
---

README.ocaml and README.sml added, README.cuddy deleted, contents NOT
updated yet.

---

All headers are now with one decription line and one copyright line a'la:
(* Structure MuddyCore provides internals for the MuDDy BDD ML Interface.    *)
(* Copyright (C) 1997-2002 by Ken Friis Larsen and Jakob Lichtenberg.        *)

---

jl: muddy.c: Windows's native compiler seems not to accept inline (or,
we do not know how to use cl correctty), hence inline is now INLINE,
and is #define'd in a #ifdef WIN32 section.

---

jl: Identifiers in bdd.sig: All identifiers are now equivalent between
SML and O'Caml!  Since SML and O'Caml disagrees about what exactly
makes up an identifier this has led to some changes in the SML
interface bdd.sig (bvec.sig and fdd.sig is unchanged):

1. true and false ( tt and ff are pragmatic names often used when
dealing with bdds):

TRUE is now tt
FALSE is now ff

3. bdd operations have been lowercased to suit OCaml:

DIFF   is now diff
IMP    is now imp
LESSTH is now lessth
BIIMP  is now biimp
OR     is now bor     (* short for bdd or *)
INVIMP is now invimp
NAND   is now nand
NOR    is now nor
AND    is now band    (* short for bdd and *)
XOR    is now xor

NOT    is now not

ITE    is now ite

4. method datatype changed (method is an OCaml keywork)

    eqtype method
    val WIN2         : method
    val WIN2ITE      : method
    val SIFT         : method
    val SIFTITE      : method
    val RANDOM       : method
    val REORDER_NONE : method

is now:

    eqtype ordering
    val win2         : ordering
    val win2ite      : ordering
    val sift         : ordering
    val siftite      : ordering
    val random       : ordering
    val reorder_none : ordering


5. A new type stats is added (since OCaml records in signatures needs
to be named)

6. To ensure easy adaption of this release all old identifiers are
'aliased' to their new name in the bottom of bdd.sig in the style
   val WIN2 = win2


---

jl: Documentation, generally: Documentation in the bottom of X.sig and
X.mli is now equivalent, (where X is bdd, fdd and bvec).  I have plans
of adopting ocamldoc documentation style, but that obviously conflicts
with Mosml style....  Advice requested.

Documentation in bdd.sig is updated.  There is still a few forward
pointers to the BuDDy manual, but we are getting there...Documentation
for fdd and bvec is still - very - sparse.

---
jl: bvec.sig, bvec.sml fdd.sig bvec.sml are updated.

---
jl: bvec.mli, bvev.ml, fdd.mli, fdd.ml are implemented.

---

cuddy_test.ml is deleted
